# IBM Professional Data Scientist Certification
This was the capstone project for my [IBM Professional Data Scientist Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)

## SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

In this project, I predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

### [SpaceX API Data Collection](SpaceX_Falcon9_First_Stage_Landing_Prediction/jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api)
- Data Collection: Retrieving data via the SpaceX API, including launch details like dates, rocket type, and payload mass.
- Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values and transforming data for analysis.
- Data Analysis: Conducting exploratory analysis to identify trends in launch data.
- Data Exporting: Saving the cleaned data to a CSV file for further use.

### [SpaceX Data Wrangling](SpaceX_Falcon9_First_Stage_Landing_Prediction/labs-jupyter-spacex-Data-wrangling)
- Exploring Launch Sites: Analyzing the number of launches from different SpaceX launch sites.
- Examining Orbit Types: Understanding various orbit types targeted by these launches.
- Data Cleaning: Preparing the data by handling missing values and removing unneeded columns.
- Data Export: Saving the cleaned and processed data into a CSV file for further analysis.
